# README Generator

## Description

A command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input. The user is prompted for his/her GitHub username, email, project title and description, installation and usage instructions, and the license that should be assigned to the project. The application creates a table of contents, checks for validation of inputs, and also generates a project link to go under the description. A badge that represents the license assigned to the project along to a link to the license is also generated. The Questions section at the end of the README includes the user's GitHub profile picture and email.
